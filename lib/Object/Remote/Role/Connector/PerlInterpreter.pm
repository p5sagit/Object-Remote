=head1 NAME

Object::Remote::Role::Connector::PerlInterpreter - Role for connections to a Perl interpreter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Object::Remote;

  my %opts = (
    perl_command => [qw(nice -n 10 perl -)],
    watchdog_timeout => 120, stderr => \*STDERR,
  );

  my $local_connection = Object::Remote->connect('-', %opts);
  my $hostname = Sys::Hostname->can::on($remote, 'hostname');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the role that supports connections to a Perl interpreter that is executed in a
different process. The new Perl interpreter can be either on the local or a remote machine
and is configurable via arguments passed to the constructor.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Inherits arguments from L<Object::Remote::Role::Connector> and provides the
following:

=over 4

=item perl_command

By default the Perl interpeter will be executed as "perl -" but this can be changed by
providing an array reference as the value to the perl_command attribute during construction.

=item stderr

If this value is defined then it will be used as the file handle that receives the output
of STDERR from the Perl interpreter process and I/O will be performed by the run loop in a
non-blocking way. If the value is undefined then STDERR of the remote process will be connected
directly to STDERR of the local process with out the run loop managing I/O. The default value
is undefined.

There are a few ways to use this feature. By default the behavior is to form one unified STDERR
across all of the Perl interpreters including the local one. For small scale and quick operation
this offers a predictable and easy to use way to get at error messages generated anywhere. If
the local Perl interpreter crashes then the remote Perl interpreters still have an active STDERR
and it is possible to still receive output from them. This is generally a good thing but can
cause issues.

When using a file handle as the output for STDERR once the local Perl interpreter is no longer
running there is no longer a valid STDERR for the remote interpreters to send data to. This means
that it is no longer possible to receive error output from the remote interpreters and that the
shell will start to kill off the child processes. Passing a reference to STDERR for the local
interpreter (as the SYNOPSIS shows) causes the run loop to manage I/O, one unified STDERR for
all Perl interpreters that ends as soon as the local interpreter process does, and the shell will
start killing children when the local interpreter exits.

It is also possible to pass in a file handle that has been opened for writing. This would be
useful for logging the output of the remote interpreter directly into a dedicated file.

=item watchdog_timeout

If this value is defined then it will be used as the number of seconds the watchdog will wait
for an update before it terminates the Perl interpreter process. The default value is undefined
and will not use the watchdog. See C<Object::Remote::Watchdog> for more information.
